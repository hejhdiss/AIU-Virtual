## LLM Behavior and Configuration

The AIU Virtual LLM operates through a sophisticated configuration-based awareness system that is both expandable and optimizable:

### Configuration-Based Awareness

Instead of detecting live system resources, the LLM reads from `/etc/aiu_config.json`:

```json
{
  "internet": false,
  "ram": "2GB",
  "storage": "50GB",
  "location": "Kerala, India",
  "timezone": "Asia/Kolkata",
  "tools": ["calculator", "summarizer", "translator", "file_browser"],
  "performance_mode": "balanced",
  "language_preferences": ["en", "ml"],
  "custom_parameters": {
    "response_length": "medium",
    "technical_detail": "high"
  }
}
```

### Task Routing Logic (Expandable)

1. **Prompt Analysis**: Parse user input for intent and required tools
2. **Tool Selection**: Match requirements to available tools based on configuration
3. **Resource Allocation**: Optimize tool usage based on system constraints
4. **Execution Planning**: Coordinate multiple tools for complex tasks
5. **Result Synthesis**: Combine tool outputs into coherent responses

This routing system is designed for easy expansion with new decision algorithms and optimization strategies.
