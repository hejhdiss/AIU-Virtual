## LLM Behavior and Configuration

The AIU Virtual LLM operates through a sophisticated configuration-based awareness system that is both expandable and optimizable:

### Environment-Optimized Models

AIU Virtual uses specially trained language models optimized for this environment:

- **Custom Training**: Models are trained specifically for AIU Virtual's tool ecosystem and workflow patterns
- **Environment Awareness**: LLMs understand the virtual environment context and available tools natively
- **Optimized Performance**: Models are fine-tuned for the specific resource constraints and capabilities of the VM environment
- **Integrated Tool Knowledge**: Built-in understanding of tool capabilities, parameters, and optimal usage patterns
- **Not Stock Models**: These are not standard models from Hugging Face or other repositories, but purpose-built for AIU Virtual

### Configuration-Based Awareness

Instead of detecting live system resources, the LLM reads from `/etc/aiu_config.json`:

```json
{
  "internet": false,
  "network_policy": "isolated",
  "network_options": {
    "allow_local": false,
    "allow_vpn": false,
    "whitelist_domains": [],
    "proxy_settings": null
  },
  "resources": {
    "ram": "2GB",
    "cpu_cores": 2,
    "storage": "50GB",
    "gpu_access": false
  },
  "token_limits": {
    "max_per_query": 4096,
    "session_budget": 50000,
    "response_max": 2048
  },
  "location": "Kerala, India",
  "timezone": "Asia/Kolkata",
  "tools": ["calculator", "summarizer", "translator", "file_browser"],
  "performance_mode": "balanced",
  "language_preferences": ["en", "ml"],
  "custom_parameters": {
    "response_length": "medium",
    "technical_detail": "high",
    "creativity_level": "moderate"
  }
}
```

### Dynamic Configuration Awareness

The AIU Virtual LLM maintains real-time awareness of configuration changes:

- **Live Configuration Monitoring**: LLM automatically detects when `/etc/aiu_config.json` is modified
- **Immediate Adaptation**: Behavior adjusts instantly to new settings without requiring restart
- **Resource Constraint Updates**: LLM immediately recognizes new RAM, CPU, or token limits
- **Tool Availability Changes**: Automatically adapts to newly enabled/disabled tools
- **Network Policy Awareness**: Instantly understands changes to network restrictions or connectivity options
- **Performance Mode Switching**: Seamlessly transitions between performance profiles (speed, balanced, efficiency)
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains conversation context while adapting to new configuration parameters

### Advanced Task Routing Logic (Expandable)

1. **Configuration Refresh**: Continuously monitor and reload configuration changes during operation
2. **Prompt Analysis**: Parse user input for intent and required tools using environment-trained understanding
3. **Resource Assessment**: Evaluate current available RAM, CPU, tokens, and network policies before task execution
4. **Tool Selection**: Match requirements to currently available tools based on live configuration and resource constraints
5. **Token Budget Management**: Allocate tokens efficiently based on current limits and session budget
6. **Network Policy Enforcement**: Respect current network restrictions and connectivity settings
7. **Execution Planning**: Coordinate multiple tools for complex tasks within current resource limits
8. **Performance Optimization**: Adjust processing based on current system load, performance mode, and user preferences
9. **Result Synthesis**: Combine tool outputs into coherent responses within current token limits

This routing system is designed for easy expansion with new decision algorithms, resource management strategies, and optimization techniques.
